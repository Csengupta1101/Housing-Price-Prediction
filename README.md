# House Price Prediction Analysis
## Machine Learning Model Development

### About -
This Project here deals with a fictional real estate company called "Dragon Real Estates". They are struggling in terms of predicting the prices of the houses in a specific area they want to expand in. Hence they require an accurate predictive analysis so that their buying decisions doesn't turn out unreasonable.


### Understanding the requirement -
As Machine learning engineers our first job is to understand the requirements properly. Exploring the business objectives . Getting an idea of what resources available and sharing what additional resources might be required for the project. These meeting are to be conducted along with stakeholders of the company. We also need to understand that what kind of solution is currently being implemented to address this issue.
